style="text-align: center;">Cannes: the go-to place for inward
investment?</td></tr></tbody></table><br />There
was certainly plenty of UK inward investment chatter coming out of MIPIM last
week, with a reported 48 UK cities and local authorities competing for the
attention of the event&rsquo;s 20,000 delegates. Many of those UK locations had
invested heavily - with money, time and effort - in an event which, judging by
the buzz surrounding it, could easily be seen as some kind of inward investment
marketing &lsquo;magic bullet&rsquo;.<br /><br /><b>But how important is
MIPIM for inward investment promotion?&nbsp;And what should inward
investment agencies be doing now that it&rsquo;s all over?</b><br
/><b></b><br /><a name='more'></a>A good place
to start with this is to point out what should be obvious: MIPIM is a property
sector event, packed to the rafters with property investors, developers, agents
and assorted service providers. So, assuming that locations want to attract more
<i>property</i> investment, it <i>may</i> be an
important forum for Investment Promotion Agencies.<br /><br />But
this is where the confusion starts. Because if you look at the UK&rsquo;s numerous
&lsquo;Invest In&hellip;&rsquo; web pages, you&rsquo;ll notice that attracting <i>property
</i>investment isn&rsquo;t the <i>main</i>&nbsp;focus of LEP and
investment agency marketing activities. Instead, there&rsquo;s a clear emphasis on
attracting businesses into their identified &lsquo;key sectors&rsquo;, such as Life
Sciences, Advanced Engineering, Digital industries and Financial Services.
Rather than targeting property&nbsp;<i>developers</i>, their
primary focus is, quite rightly, on attracting
property&nbsp;<i>occupiers</i>&nbsp;- &lsquo;end user&rsquo; companies
with the potential to create sustainable new jobs and wealth for their local
economies. And you won&rsquo;t find <i>these</i> companies at MIPIM.<br
/><br /><b>So why all this emphasis on a property sector
event?</b><br /><br />It&rsquo;s a very good question. In some
cases, no doubt, regional activities at MIPIM are carefully thought through;
driven by an identified strategic need to secure more property investments as a
basis for attracting more &lsquo;end user&rsquo; inward investors. However, it&rsquo;s equally
clear that often this isn&rsquo;t the case. Some of the regional PR surrounding MIPIM
this year talked about the event as an essential forum for generating investment
leads in key sectors such as digital industries and advanced engineering. I
would simply ask: how? These are clear cases of strategic confusion -
a<i>&nbsp;property event</i>&nbsp;has been mistaken for
an&nbsp;<i>inward investment promotion event</i>, and the
strategic distinction between targeting&nbsp;<i>property
developers</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>property
occupiers</i>&nbsp;has been lost along the way.<br /><br
/><b>But there&rsquo;s one other reason why it <i>might</i> make
sense to focus on a property event: <i>property
agents</i>.&nbsp;</b>After all, aren&rsquo;t they
the&nbsp;<i>key intermediarie</i>s when it comes to attracting
those wealth and employment creating &lsquo;end user&rsquo; businesses?<br /><br
/>My own experience tells me that property agents do precisely what they&rsquo;re
paid to do: they try to match occupiers with suitable sites and buildings.
They&rsquo;re not paid to display loyalty to particular regions, and, typically,
they&rsquo;re not immersed in the detailed Value Propositions that (hopefully) make
your location stand out from the rest (including, for example, your large pool
of skilled workers, R&amp;D capabilities, industry clustering or excellent
training provision). They can be important intermediaries, but they won&rsquo;t do
your job for you, and networking with them doesn&rsquo;t justify the expense lavished
on MIPIM.<br /><br /><b>The need for sustained, targeted,
Inward Investment Marketing:</b><br /><br />So, MIPIM may be a
suitable forum for Investment Promotion Agencies with clear objectives relating
to the attraction of property investment. However, it most certainly isn&rsquo;t the
place to find the &lsquo;end user&rsquo; inward investors which, every other week of the
year, are their top priority.<br /><br />The fact is that there is
no &lsquo;magic bullet&rsquo; event or other activity for attracting inward investment. It
requires sustained, targeted marketing and business development activity, every
day, year round, with regions presenting clearly defined <a

Propositions</a> and <i><a
href="http://www.clarity-strategies.com/p/inbound-marketing.html">location
solutions</a></i> to prospective inward investors on an
<i>ongoing</i> basis. It&rsquo;s hard work and finding real inward
investment prospects is <i>difficult</i>. But that&rsquo;s all the more
reason not to take refuge in activities that appear to be, but really aren&rsquo;t,
quick-fix solutions.<br /><br /><br /><div
