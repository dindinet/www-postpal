/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been
three fascinating years since we established Clarity specifically to focus on
Inward Investment Marketing. So what have we learned during that time? And what
insights can we offer about Inward Investment Marketing in 2015?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br
/&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a
name=&#39;more&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Here are three key insights from our three years
specialising in Inward Investment Marketing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1.
&amp;lsquo;Solutions Marketing&amp;rsquo; is the Way Forward&lt;/h3&gt;Over the last few years, many
leading businesses have invested in blogs that aim to &amp;lsquo;inform&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;solve
customers&amp;rsquo; problems&amp;rsquo; rather than &amp;lsquo;sell&amp;rsquo; in the traditional way. It&amp;rsquo;s an
effective approach because it focuses on the needs of the customer, builds trust
and highlights expertise as a basis for winning sales. Exemplary
&amp;lsquo;business-to-business&amp;rsquo; blogs include&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
href=&#34;https://forums.cat.com/t5/BLOG-On-The-Level/bg-p/CT_Blog&#34;&gt;Caterpillar&lt;/a&gt;
(construction equipment) and &lt;a
href=&#34;http://blog.jll.eu/research/&#34;&gt;JLL&lt;/a&gt; (property).&lt;br
/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve found that inward investment agencies
&lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; host and deliver excellent, solutions-focused blogs that
address the &amp;lsquo;location choice drivers&amp;rsquo; of expanding businesses, especially when
they team up with expert guest contributors from regional partner organisations
and companies. The benefits include building the region&amp;rsquo;s online profile
significantly (working with partners creates&lt;i&gt; scale&lt;/i&gt; and
&lt;i&gt;more informative content&lt;/i&gt;) and nurturing strong, on-going
relationships with expanding businesses. We think more investment agencies and
regional partnerships should seriously consider this approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. It&amp;rsquo;s All About the Data (and How it&amp;rsquo;s
Presented)&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;More than ever before, &lt;a
href=&#34;http://www.clarity-strategies.com/2014/10/commercial-property-marketing-its-time.html&#34;&gt;businesses
make investment decisions on the basis of reliable data&lt;/a&gt; - most
obviously relating to costs - so communicating location data &lt;i&gt;clearly
and accessibly&lt;/i&gt; should be at the heart of effective Inward Investment
Marketing. That&amp;rsquo;s the rationale behind the ever-growing popularity of
&lt;i&gt;infographics &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;data visualisation.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br
/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, most of the &amp;lsquo;infographics&amp;rsquo; we see fail to
communicate the data (i.e. the &lt;i&gt;numbers&lt;/i&gt;) clearly, or state
where the data came from, thereby being of little or no use to expanding
businesses. Inward investment marketers should therefore &lt;i&gt;be wary of the
attractive but useless infographic&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the
other hand, well implemented (i.e. accurate, clear, source-referenced)
infographics can enable investment agencies to communicate powerful location
data in a highly effective way. As a business, we&amp;rsquo;re increasingly focused on
developing interactive infographics driven by live data feeds (i.e.
database-linked). The objective has to be more informative and valuable inward
investment marketing content that communicates reliable location data in a way
that&amp;rsquo;s easy to consume, easy to update &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; great to look at
at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Inward Investment
Marketers Need to Keep Moving with the Times&amp;hellip;&lt;/h3&gt;The world of marketing
has moved extremely quickly over the last three years, sometimes making it
difficult to keep up. What&amp;rsquo;s certain is that the internet has driven the biggest
changes, and that inward investment marketers need to keep moving with the
times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To cite just a couple of examples:&lt;br
/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Online Content Marketing (blogging)
requires a new kind of &lt;i&gt;solutions-driven&lt;/i&gt; content - it&amp;rsquo;s not
enough just to post old-style &lt;i&gt;news&lt;/i&gt; press releases (written
for &lt;i&gt;editors&lt;/i&gt; not &lt;i&gt;readers&lt;/i&gt;) to your
blog.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Social media is now a serious marketing tool, as
increasing numbers of business decision makers engage on platforms such as
LinkedIn. Inward investment marketers need to get
social.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;In Summary&amp;hellip;&lt;/h3&gt;The priorities
for inward investment marketers in 2015 should be to move from traditional
&amp;lsquo;sales&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;PR&amp;rsquo; messages to location &amp;lsquo;solutions marketing&amp;rsquo;, underpinned by a
higher quality of data that investors can &lt;i&gt;confidently&lt;/i&gt;
incorporate into location evaluations. And they need to project these more
robust messages to prospective investors and intermediaries via up-to-date,
online channels and networks. Agencies that do these things will be in a
position to inform and influence business location decisions more than ever
before, thereby delivering real added value for their locations.&lt;br
/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We could go on, but &amp;lsquo;Four Key Insights for Three Years&amp;rsquo;
wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have worked so well. So all that&amp;rsquo;s left for us to say is
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thank You&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; to all the clients and
collaborators we&amp;rsquo;ve had the pleasure of working with since 2012.&lt;br
/&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Nick

      <title>After MIPIM: Time for Sustained,Targeted Inward Investment Marketing</title>

style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;Cannes: the go-to place for inward
investment?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There
was certainly plenty of UK inward investment chatter coming out of MIPIM last
week, with a reported 48 UK cities and local authorities competing for the
attention of the event&amp;rsquo;s 20,000 delegates. Many of those UK locations had
invested heavily - with money, time and effort - in an event which, judging by
the buzz surrounding it, could easily be seen as some kind of inward investment
marketing &amp;lsquo;magic bullet&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But how important is
MIPIM for inward investment promotion?&amp;nbsp;And what should inward
investment agencies be doing now that it&amp;rsquo;s all over?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br
/&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&#39;more&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A good place
to start with this is to point out what should be obvious: MIPIM is a property
sector event, packed to the rafters with property investors, developers, agents
and assorted service providers. So, assuming that locations want to attract more
&lt;i&gt;property&lt;/i&gt; investment, it &lt;i&gt;may&lt;/i&gt; be an
important forum for Investment Promotion Agencies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But
this is where the confusion starts. Because if you look at the UK&amp;rsquo;s numerous
&amp;lsquo;Invest In&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo; web pages, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that attracting &lt;i&gt;property
&lt;/i&gt;investment isn&amp;rsquo;t the &lt;i&gt;main&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;focus of LEP and
investment agency marketing activities. Instead, there&amp;rsquo;s a clear emphasis on
attracting businesses into their identified &amp;lsquo;key sectors&amp;rsquo;, such as Life
Sciences, Advanced Engineering, Digital industries and Financial Services.
Rather than targeting property&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;developers&lt;/i&gt;, their
primary focus is, quite rightly, on attracting
property&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;occupiers&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;- &amp;lsquo;end user&amp;rsquo; companies
with the potential to create sustainable new jobs and wealth for their local
economies. And you won&amp;rsquo;t find &lt;i&gt;these&lt;/i&gt; companies at MIPIM.&lt;br
/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;So why all this emphasis on a property sector
event?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a very good question. In some
cases, no doubt, regional activities at MIPIM are carefully thought through;
driven by an identified strategic need to secure more property investments as a
basis for attracting more &amp;lsquo;end user&amp;rsquo; inward investors. However, it&amp;rsquo;s equally
clear that often this isn&amp;rsquo;t the case. Some of the regional PR surrounding MIPIM
this year talked about the event as an essential forum for generating investment
leads in key sectors such as digital industries and advanced engineering. I
would simply ask: how? These are clear cases of strategic confusion -
a&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;property event&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;has been mistaken for
an&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;inward investment promotion event&lt;/i&gt;, and the
strategic distinction between targeting&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;property
developers&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;property
occupiers&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;has been lost along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
/&gt;&lt;b&gt;But there&amp;rsquo;s one other reason why it &lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; make
sense to focus on a property event: &lt;i&gt;property
agents&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;After all, aren&amp;rsquo;t they
the&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;key intermediarie&lt;/i&gt;s when it comes to attracting
those wealth and employment creating &amp;lsquo;end user&amp;rsquo; businesses?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
/&gt;My own experience tells me that property agents do precisely what they&amp;rsquo;re
paid to do: they try to match occupiers with suitable sites and buildings.
They&amp;rsquo;re not paid to display loyalty to particular regions, and, typically,
they&amp;rsquo;re not immersed in the detailed Value Propositions that (hopefully) make
your location stand out from the rest (including, for example, your large pool
of skilled workers, R&amp;amp;D capabilities, industry clustering or excellent
training provision). They can be important intermediaries, but they won&amp;rsquo;t do
your job for you, and networking with them doesn&amp;rsquo;t justify the expense lavished
on MIPIM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The need for sustained, targeted,
Inward Investment Marketing:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, MIPIM may be a
suitable forum for Investment Promotion Agencies with clear objectives relating
to the attraction of property investment. However, it most certainly isn&amp;rsquo;t the
place to find the &amp;lsquo;end user&amp;rsquo; inward investors which, every other week of the
year, are their top priority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact is that there is
no &amp;lsquo;magic bullet&amp;rsquo; event or other activity for attracting inward investment. It
requires sustained, targeted marketing and business development activity, every
day, year round, with regions presenting clearly defined &lt;a
href=&#34;http://www.clarity-strategies.com/p/strategy-development.html&#34;&gt;Value
Propositions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;i&gt;&lt;a
href=&#34;http://www.clarity-strategies.com/p/inbound-marketing.html&#34;&gt;location
solutions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; to prospective inward investors on an
&lt;i&gt;ongoing&lt;/i&gt; basis. It&amp;rsquo;s hard work and finding real inward
investment prospects is &lt;i&gt;difficult&lt;/i&gt;. But that&amp;rsquo;s all the more
reason not to take refuge in activities that appear to be, but really aren&amp;rsquo;t,
quick-fix solutions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div

      <title>B2B and Industrial Marketing: Why is Social Media Confusing Us? </title>

style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s Confused by Social Media.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some
interesting findings regarding industrial companies and social media marketing
from GlobalSpec’s recent survey: &lt;a
href=&#34;http://beta.globalspec.com/advertising/trends-wp/2012_Marketing_Trends_WP&#34;&gt;Trends
in Industrial Marketing 2012&lt;/a&gt;: How Manufacturers are Marketing
Today:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&#39;more&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br
/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;57% of industrial companies now use social media
applications&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;37% of them are spending more on social media
activities in 2012 than in 2011&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br
/&gt;&lt;b&gt;But…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Only 17% of them are happy with their social
media efforts&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conclusions to draw
from these findings are pretty obvious: most industrial companies have taken the
decision to embrace social media marketing, but when it comes to implementation
and getting results, they’re confused and disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
/&gt;&lt;b&gt;So, what seems to be the problem?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
/&gt;The social media phenomenon is massive and fast-moving, so there is, no
doubt, a whole gamut of reasons why B2B and industrial marketers are fazed by
it. But I’ve got a strong suspicion of what lies at the heart of the problem -
the very real, but not always clearly defined or understood, differences between
‘consumer’ and &amp;lsquo;B2B&amp;rsquo; (business-to-business) marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
/&gt;&lt;b&gt;How are consumer marketers using social media?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br
/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think about the social media-focused campaigns that hit the
headlines – the car manufacturer’s orange ‘&lt;a
href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzG4afr9yBI&amp;amp;feature=related&#34;&gt;spokespuppet&lt;/a&gt;’,
for example, or the chocolate company’s ‘&lt;a
href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVblWq3tDwY&#34;&gt;eyebrow dance&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;.
I suspect that many of my B2B marketing colleagues would share the sentiments of
the thought leader who posted this comment on YouTube:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
/&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;What the hell does
this s**t have to do with chocolate?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br
/&gt;What the hell indeed. The fact is that consumer marketers (companies
selling goods like cars and chocolate to individual consumers) are using social
media forums like Facebook in ways that often don’t make immediate sense to B2B
and industrial marketers. They’re engaging in online conversations with their
customers that often seem (or perhaps are) trivial, have no
&lt;i&gt;obvious&lt;/i&gt; goals and have no direct connection to the act of
purchasing the company’s product (e.g. no link to a website where the product
can actually be bought). And we, the B2B crowd, are looking at it all and
thinking: there’s something new and important going on here, but I don’t know
what it is, or how it&amp;rsquo;s relevant to me promoting my light engineering
business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;So why are consumer marketers doing it
like that?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, our groovy consumer marketing
peers are doing something that would never cross the minds of most B2B and
industrial marketers. The primary objective of their social media activities is
to nurture positive &lt;i&gt;feelings&lt;/i&gt; towards their brands at an
&lt;i&gt;emotional&lt;/i&gt; rather than rational level - to make consumers feel
a &lt;i&gt;connection&lt;/i&gt; with their brand. By uploading your dancing
eyebrows clip, you’ll feel an &lt;i&gt;affinity&lt;/i&gt; with the chocolatier;
by filming your dog lip-synching to Lady Gaga, you’re
&lt;i&gt;engaging&lt;/i&gt; personally with the broadband supplier.&lt;br
/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s all based on the fact that our buying decisions as
consumers are strongly influenced by our feelings towards
&lt;b&gt;brands&lt;/b&gt; – much more than rational cost-benefit analyses. We
buy into the whole world of Apple products because we embrace everything that is
‘Apple’ – from its design ethos to the fact that it’s not Microsoft – not
because, say, we get more processing power per pound spent. And many consumers,
clearly, are prepared to spend their time engaging with social media campaigns
that are carefully conceived to develop the sense of affinity between themselves
and their favourite brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But is this approach
applicable to B2B and Industrial Marketing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
/&gt;Let’s think this one through. The ‘brand affinity’ approach to consumer
social media marketing is based on an understanding of how
&lt;i&gt;consumers&lt;/i&gt; make buying decisions. For example:&lt;br
/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consumer buying decisions are often
primarily emotional, not rational (e.g. your new
car)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consumers often buy stuff primarily for pleasure, not
utility&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consumers are usually only accountable to themselves
(or at most, to their partners or parents)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consumers often
associate brands with their individual identities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consumers
won’t lose their jobs for making duff buying
decisions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I’m not going to argue that
corporate buyers are automatons, uninfluenced by emotion or the power of brands.
However, I will argue that corporate buying is fundamentally different from
consumer buying, in that it’s primarily rational and utilitarian, and because
corporate buyers are responsible to shareholders. They could lose their jobs if
their buying decisions aren’t sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of which leads
me to the conclusion that &lt;b&gt;corporate buyers need &lt;i&gt;solutions
&lt;/i&gt;to their essentially practical procurement
&lt;i&gt;problems&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. They need products that are longer
lasting, cheaper, easier to use, lower maintenance, faster, and so on – they
need to maximise ROI. But guess what? You knew that already. Providing solutions
to your customers’ problems is what you’ve always done, and what has made your
company successful. A change in the media environment, from printed materials to
the internet, doesn’t change that fundamental fact. It does, however, open up a
whole range of new ways of communicating your solutions to your prospective
customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How B2B and industrial companies can
use social media to solve their customers’ problems&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
/&gt;I’ll keep this bit simple. Why not just do it like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
/&gt;1. Identify your customers’ problems, and how your products and services
provide the solutions they need&lt;br /&gt;2. Make those solutions the focus of
your website, both in terms of static page content and a regularly updated blog

blogging&amp;rsquo;&amp;nbsp;here&lt;/a&gt;). This will help you get found on search
engines, and make your prospective customers want to engage with you (read more

your website&amp;nbsp;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;3. Post your
&lt;i&gt;solution-rich&lt;/i&gt; articles to your company social media pages
(e.g. LinkedIn, Twitter and Google+) so that prospective buyers in need of your
solutions can follow you there (and you can find out who they are).&lt;br
/&gt;4. Optimise your website with &amp;lsquo;calls-to-action&amp;rsquo;, so that your prospective
customers can subscribe to receive your solutions by e-mail (and you can find
out who they are)&lt;br /&gt;5. Think about where your prospective customers go
online in search of solutions (e.g. LinkedIn industry discussion groups) and
post your articles there too&lt;br /&gt;6. Remember that your customers want
solutions to their problems not sales pitches. Therefore give them ’10 ways to
cut the costs of machining titanium’, rather than ‘buy our new miracle cutting
tool today!!!’&lt;br /&gt;7. Don’t waste your customers’ time with social media
tittle tattle. As you know, they’re corporate buyers, not teenagers following
the X Factor&lt;br /&gt;8. Talk about what’s of interest to your customers
(solutions to their problems), not what’s of interest to you (Geoff’s
retirement, your latest award, or the great work your company does for
charity)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when your marketing company bangs on about
your ‘brand’ (because that’s what &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; like to talk about)
remember that you’re probably not Caterpillar or Cadburys, and that they’ve
probably not completely nailed the differences between consumer and B2B
marketing. Your ‘brand’ is all about your ability to solve your customers’
problems. And that’s what you need to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
